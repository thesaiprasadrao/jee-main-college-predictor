{College Admission Predictor with Machine Learning}{}
{Python, scikit-learn, pandas, RandomForest, CLI}{}
\resumeItemListStart
\item Developed an intelligent college admission prediction system using machine learning algorithms with 93.53\% accuracy on 200,000+ real admission records from 2020-2024.
\item Implemented Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models with comprehensive feature engineering, achieving Mean Absolute Error of 2,737 ranks for JEE Main cutoff predictions.
\item Built interactive CLI interface with college recommendations, safety analysis, and rank-based filtering across multiple categories (General, OBC, SC/ST, EWS).
\item Engineered data processing pipeline handling CSV datasets from IITs, NITs, and IIITs with automated model training and persistence using joblib.
